# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/data/
    - assets/data/faculty_details/
    - assets/data/about_department/
    - assets/data/curriculum_data/
    - assets/images/themes/
    - assets/images/app_bar/
    - assets/images/branches/
    - assets/images/icons/
    - assets/images/pfpholder.jpg
    - assets/images/tsecImages.png
    - assets/images/tsecimage.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF Pro Text
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Semibold.otf
          weight: 600
    - family: Priego 
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/priego-extrabold.otf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/priego-bold.otf
          weight: 700 
        - asset: assets/fonts/priego-semibold.otf
          weight: 600 
        - asset: assets/fonts/priego-medium.otf
          weight: 500 
        - asset: assets/fonts/priego-regular.otf
          weight: 400 
    - family: Inter 
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800

          weight: 700 
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600 
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
